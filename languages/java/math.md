#### Integer literals
An integer literal is assumed to be of the `int` type, unless denoted with `L` or `l` (uppercase L preferred) like `2147483648L`. An integer is also assumed to be in decimal base.

Integer in other number bases is prefixed with:
- binary, `0b`/`0B`, `0B1111`
- octal, `0`, `07777`
- hexadecimal, `0x/0X`, `0XFFFF`
