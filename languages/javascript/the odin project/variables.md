#### `const`
```js
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
```
All caps for "hard-coded" values.

```js
const pageLoadTime; /* time taken by a webpage to load */
```
The value of `pageLoadTime` is not known before the page load, so it’s named normally. But it’s still a constant because it doesn’t change after the assignment.
